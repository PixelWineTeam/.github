## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

This team was **renamed** from [Pixel Dev Team](https://github.com/pixel-dev-team)<br>
(because the admins found that it may have duplicated the name of the [Google Pixel Development Team](https://github.com/pixeldevteam)).<br>
Although *PixelWine Team* was said to have existed for a long time, the name has been revived again.<br>
### ***We don't seek to agree on everything, BUT we hope we can work together to accomplish our common goal, which is the [PixelWineTeam](https://github.com/PixelWineTeam).***
By the way: *PixelWine Team* is a.k.a. *PWTeam*.<br>
We were going to change the GitHub username to pwteam, but this is already being used by a user. (OH HOLY SHIT!)😒

## 大家好 👋

这个团队由[Pixel Dev Team](https://github.com/pixel-dev-team) 改名而来.<br>
(因为管理员发现它可能与 [Google Pixel Development Team](https://github.com/pixeldevteam) 的名字重复）。<br>
虽说 PixelWine Team 已经存在了很久（且早已被停用），但这个名字现在又被我们恢复使用了。<br>
### ***我们不求事事一致，但我们希望我们能一起努力完成我们的共同目标，这就是[PixelWineTeam](https://github.com/PixelWineTeam).***<br>

BTW: PixelWine Team 又名 PWTeam。我们本打算把 GitHub 的用户名改为 pwteam ，但这已经被一个用户使用了。(TMD!)😒<br>
